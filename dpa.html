        <p>
          Where this DPA uses the terms defined in the GDPR or the FADP, as
          applicable, those terms shall have the same meaning as in that law.
        </p>
        <p>
          This DPA shall be read and interpreted in the light of the provisions
          of the GDPR and the FADP, as applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that conflicts with
          rights and obligations provided for in the GDPR or the FADP, as
          applicable, or prejudices the fundamental rights or freedoms of the
          data subjects.

        <h2 id="obligations-of-the-parties">Obligations of the Parties</h2>
        <h3 id="general">General</h3>
        <p>
          The data processor shall process personal data only on documented
          instructions from the data controller, notably in relationship with
          the Services, unless required to do so by Union, Member States or
          Swiss law to which the processor is subject. In this case, the
          processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before
          processing, unless the law prohibits this on important grounds of
          public interest. Subsequent instructions may also be given by the data
          controller throughout the duration of the processing of personal data.
          Such instructions shall always be documented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data processor shall immediately inform the data controller if
          instructions given by the data controller, in the opinion of the data
          processor, infringe applicable Union, Member States or Swiss data
          protection provisions.
        </p>
        <h3 id="purpose-limitation">Purpose limitation</h3>
        <p>
          The data processor shall process the personal data only for the
          specific purpose(s) of the processing, as set out in this DPA
        </p>
        <h3 id="erasure-or-return-of-data">Erasure or return of data</h3>
        <p>
          Processing by the data processor shall only take place for the
          duration necessary for the purpose of the Base Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon termination of the provision of personal data processing services
          or termination pursuant to Clause ‎8, the data processor shall delete
          all personal data processed on behalf of the data controller and
          certify to the data controller that it has done so and delete existing
          copies unless Union, Member States or Swiss law requires storage of
          the personal data.
        </p>
        <h3 id="security-of-processing">Security of processing</h3>
        <p>
          The data processor shall implement the technical and organizational
          measures specified in Annex 1 to ensure the security of the personal
          data, including protection against accidental or unlawful destruction,
          loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to that data
          (personal data breach), in accordance with Article 5, Article 28(3)(c)
          and Article 32 GDPR and Article 8 FADP.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of a personal data breach concerning data processed by
          the data processor, it shall notify the data controller without undue
          delay and at the latest within 48 hours after having become aware of
          the breach. Where, and insofar as, it is not possible to provide all
          information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain
          the information then available and further information shall be
          provided as it becomes available without undue delay.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data processor shall cooperate in good faith with and assist the
          data controller in any way necessary to enable the data controller to
          notify, where relevant, the competent data protection authority and
          the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of
          processing and the information available to the data processor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data processor shall grant access to the data to members of its
          personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the
          implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. The data
          processor shall ensure that persons authorized to process the personal
          data received have committed themselves to confidentiality or are
          under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
        </p>
        <h3 id="documentation-and-compliance">Documentation and compliance</h3>
        <p>
          The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with this DPA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data processor shall deal in due time and properly with all
          reasonable inquiries from the data controller that relate to the
          processing under this DPA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data processor shall make available to the data controller all
          information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
          obligations set out in this DPA and that are stemming directly from
          the GDPR or the FADP and at the data controller’s request, allow for
          and contribute to reviews of data files and documentation or of audits
          of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, in particular
          if there are indications of non-compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data controller may choose to conduct the audit by itself, to
          mandate, at its own cost, an independent auditor or to rely on an
          independent audit mandated by the data processor. Where the data
          processor mandates an audit, it has to bear the costs of the
          independent auditor. The data controller&#39;s audit, access, and
          inspection rights under this Clause are limited to the data
          processor&#39;s records only (including inter-alia the registers of
          personal data processing activities, the registers of recipients of
          personal data) and does not apply to Processor’s physical premises.
          Any audit and request for information shall be limited to information
          necessary for the purposes of this DPA and shall give due regard to
          the data processor&#39;s confidentiality obligations and legitimate
          interest to protect business secrets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data processor and data controller shall make the information
          referred to in this Clause, including the results of any audits,
          available to the competent supervisory authority on request if and to
          the extent required by the GDPR or the FADP, as applicable.
        </p>
        <h3 id="use-of-sub-processors">Use of Sub-processors</h3>
        <p>
          The data processor has the data controller’s general authorization for
          the engagement of sub-processors. The list of sub-processors of the
          data processor can be found here:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://qfield.cloud/subprocessors"
              >https://qfield.cloud/subprocessors</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The data processor shall inform in text form the data controller of
          any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement
          of sub-processors at least 10 days in advance, thereby giving the data
          controller the opportunity to object to such changes prior to the
          engagement of the concerned sub-processor(s). Such objection shall not
          be unreasonably raised. The Parties shall keep the list up to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where the data processor engages a sub-processor for carrying out
          specific processing activities (on behalf of the data controller), it
          shall do so by way of a contract which imposes on the sub-processor
          the same obligations as the ones imposed on the data processor under
          this DPA. The data processor shall ensure that the sub-processor
          complies with the obligations to which the data processor is subject
          pursuant to this DPA, Article 28(2) to (4) GDPR and Article 9(3) FADP.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data processor shall provide, at the data controller’s request, a
          copy of such a sub-processor agreement and subsequent amendments to
          the data controller.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data processor shall remain fully responsible to the data
          controller for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations
          under its contract with the data processor. The data processor shall
          notify the data controller of any failure by the sub-processor to
          fulfil its obligations under that contract.
        </p>
        <h3 id="international-transfers">International transfers</h3>
        <p>
          Any transfer of data to a &quot;Third Country&quot; (any country
          outside of the EU/EEA and Switzerland) or an international
          organization by the data processor shall be undertaken only if
          authorized in accordance with Section A and shall take place in
          compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR and Section 2 of the FADP, as
          applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data controller agrees that where the data processor engages a
          sub-processor in accordance with Clause ‎4.6 for carrying out specific
          processing activities (on behalf of the data controller) in a Third
          Country and those processing activities involve transfer of personal
          data within the meaning of the GDPR or the FADP, as applicable, the
          processor and the sub-processor may use standard contractual clauses
          adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 46(2) GDPR in order
          to comply with the requirements of Chapter V of the GDPR, provided the
          conditions for the use of those clauses are met and provided that an
          internal assessment concluded that such transfer meets the level of
          data protection of the GDPR and the FADP.
        </p>
        <h2 id="data-subject-rights">Data Subject Rights</h2>

          reviewing, and deleting user accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of common user accounts is avoided. In cases where this is
          necessary, it is ensured that all users of the common account have the
          same roles and responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          When granting access or assigning user roles, the “need-to-know
          principle” shall be observed in order to limit the number of users
          having access to personal data only to those who require it for
          achieving the Processor’s processing purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where authentication mechanisms are based on passwords, the data
          processor requires the password to comply with documented strong
          encryption and password handling regulations.
