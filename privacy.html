        <h2>Exercising Your CCPA/CPRA Data Protection Rights</h2>
        <p>Please see the &quot;Do Not Sell My Personal Information&quot; section and &quot;Limit the Use or Disclosure of My Sensitive Personal Information&quot; section for more information on how to opt out and limit the use of sensitive information collected.</p>
        <p>Additionally, in order to exercise any of Your rights under the CCPA/CPRA, and if You are a California resident, You can contact Us:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>By email: copyright@qfield.cloud</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Only You, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that You authorize to act on Your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to Your personal information.</p>
        <p>Your request to Us must:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Provide sufficient information that allows Us to reasonably verify You are the person about whom We collected personal information or an authorized representative</li>
        <li>Describe Your request with sufficient detail that allows Us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We cannot respond to Your request or provide You with the required information if We cannot:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Verify Your identity or authority to make the request</li>
        <li>And confirm that the personal information relates to You</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will disclose and deliver the required information free of charge within 45 days of receiving Your verifiable request. The time period to provide the required information may be extended once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary and with prior notice.</p>
        <p>Any disclosures We provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable request's receipt.</p>
        <p>For data portability requests, We will select a format to provide Your personal information that is readily usable and should allow You to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
        <h2>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h2>
        <p>As defined in the CCPA/CPRA, &quot;sell&quot; and &quot;sale&quot; mean selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a Consumer's personal information by the Business to a third party for valuable consideration. This means that We may have received some kind of benefit in return for sharing personal information, but not necessarily a monetary benefit.</p>
        <p>We do not sell personal information as the term sell is commonly understood. We do allow Service Providers to use Your personal information for the business purposes described in Our Privacy Policy,  and these may be deemed a sale under CCPA/CPRA.</p>
        <p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of Your personal information. Once We receive and confirm a verifiable consumer request from You, we will stop selling Your personal information. To exercise Your right to opt-out, please contact Us.</p>
        <h2>Limit the Use or Disclosure of My Sensitive Personal Information</h2>
        <p>If You are a California resident, You have the right to limit the use and disclosure of Your sensitive personal information to that use which is necessary to perform the services or provide the goods reasonably expected by an average Consumer who requests such services or goods.</p>
        <p>We collect, use and disclose sensitive personal information in ways that are necessary to provide the Service. For more information on how We use Your personal information, please see the &quot;Use of Your Personal Data&quot; section or contact us.</p>

        <h1>California Privacy Rights for Minor Users (California Business and Professions Code Section 22581)</h1>

        <h1>Children's Privacy</h1>
        <p>The Service may contain content appropriate for children under the age of 13. As a parent, you should know that through the Service children under the age of 13 may participate in activities that involve the collection or use of personal information. We use reasonable efforts to ensure that before we collect any personal information from a child, the child's parent receives notice of and consents to our personal information practices.</p>
        <p>We also may limit how We collect, use, and store some of the information of Users between 13 and 18 years old. In some cases, this means We will be unable to provide certain functionality of the Service to these Users. If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>
        <p>We may ask a User to verify its date of birth before collecting any personal information from them. If the User is under the age of 13, the Service will be either blocked or redirected to a parental consent process.</p>

        <p>The Company may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child when submitted by a child with prior parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the child:</p>
        <ul>

        <li>Review, correct or delete the child's personal information</li>
